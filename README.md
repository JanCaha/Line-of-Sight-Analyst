## Release and building the toolbox

The release version of the toolbox is produced using makefile ([cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) make) in order to make the it more easy for development. The make command requires [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) with [Yasha](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yasha/) package ([Yasha github](https://github.com/kblomqvist/yasha)). The makefile compiles and prepares all the necessary files into **release** folder as well as it prepares ziped file.
