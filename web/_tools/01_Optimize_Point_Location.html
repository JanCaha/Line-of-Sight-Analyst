		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		A tool designed for optimization of point location with respect to values of the raster. The tool selects highest value of the raster within the distance for searching and moves the point to that location. The higher value of the raster is likely to point at locations with higher visibility potential. However, in some cases the higher raster values do not necessarily lead to better visibility. This is caused by the fact that the visibility is affected by many parameters and thus it is quite problematic to properly optimize point's locations.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The optimization can be based on elevation or other surface characteristics like positive openness or local dominance that are implemented in 
		<a href"http://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/en/rvt#v">Relief Visualization Toolbox</a>.
