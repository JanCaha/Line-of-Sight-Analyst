		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		A tool used to analyse LoS. The tool should be used only on local LoS that connect observer points with target points. There is another tool for analyses of Global LoS.

	Parameters <strong>Object size</strong>, <strong>Recognition acuinty</strong> and <strong>Clear visibility distance limit</strong> are summarized in parameter group <strong>Fuzzy visibility</strong> as they are related to fuzzy visibility calculation only. Parameters <strong>Use earth curvature corrections?</strong> and <strong>Refractivity coefficient</strong> in parameter group <strong>Curvature corrections</strong>.
