		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		A tool used to analyse Global LoS. The tool should not be used for local LoS that connect only observer to target.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For purpose of these analyses the target point can not be a global horizon. This assumption allows to properly calculate all the characteristics of global LoS.
