		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		A tool used to create Lines of Sight amongst observer and target points. Offsets of both observer and target points are specified as fields to allow individual setting for each point. LoS are created between every observer and target point which means that if there are \( n \) observer points and \( m \) target ponts then there will be \( n \times m \) lines-of-sight.

		<h2>Outputs</h2>
		</p>Line feature class with lines-of-sight, that has Z-dimension. Specific fields are <strong>OID_OBSERV</strong>, <strong>observ_offset</strong>, <strong>OID_TARGET</strong> and <strong>target_offset</strong> which are necessary for further analyses. The geometry store coordinates (X,Y and Z) purely from the surface without the offsets which are stored in fields.<p>
