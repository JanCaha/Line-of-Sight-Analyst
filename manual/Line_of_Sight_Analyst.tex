\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Line of Sight Analyst} toolbox is a Python toolbox for ArcGIS of version 10.x. The tool aims to extend possibilities provided by existing tools \textit{Construct Sight Lines} and \textit{Line of Sight} in ArcGIS \textit{3D Analyst's Visibility toolbox}.

While \textit{Line of Sight} can be used to determine if target points are visible from observer points, which parts of the line-of-sight (LoS) are visible and invisible and where is the main obstacle located on LoS. These informations form an important part of the visibility information, however, these are often inadequate for proper assessment of visibility. Complete visibility assessment requires calculation of several LoS characteristics that can not be done by existing tools in ArcGIS.

\textbf{Line of Sight Analyst} provides tools for easier creation of LoS, analysing LoS and extracting important points from LoS. Besides these functions that are directly related to the visibility analysis the toolbox contains a tool for optimization of point location based on raster values.

\end{figure} 

\subsection{Optimize Point Location}

A tool designed for optimization of point location with respect to values of the raster. The tool selects highest value of the raster within the distance for searching and moves the point to that location. The higher value of the raster is likely to point at locations with higher visibility potential. However, in some cases the higher raster values do not necessarily lead to better visibility. This is caused by the fact that the visibility is affected by many parameters and thus it is quite problematic to properly optimize point's locations.

The optimization can be based on elevation or other surface characteristics like positive openness or local dominance that are implemented in \textit{Relief Visualization Toolbox} \citep{Kokalj2016}.

\subsubsection{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Optimization raster} - \textit{raster} - layer that is used to optimize point location (e.g. elevation, local dominance, positive openness or some other characteristics)
	\item \textbf{Points to be optimized} - \textit{features - points} - points which location should be optimized
	\item \textbf{Distance for searching} - \textit{numerical value} - distance around points in which the better positions are searched. (The higher the value the longer the running time of the tool!)
	\item \textbf{Optimized points} - \textit{features - points} - output layer of optimized points.
	\item \textbf{Use mask?} - \textit{boolean} - variable that defines if the mask for point's location should be used.
	\item \textbf{Mask} - \textit{raster} - raster where values higher then zero specifies locations that can be used for point location. Values lower or equal to zero define areas that can not be used for points.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output}

New point feature class with points moved to optimized locations.

\subsection{Create Lines of Sight}
\label{Sec:createLoS}
A tool used to create Lines of Sight amongst observer and target points. Offsets of both observer and target points are specified as fields to allow individual setting for each point. LoS are created between every observer and target point which means that if there are $n$ observer points and $m$ target ponts then there will be $n \times m$ lines-of-sight.

\subsubsection{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Surface} - \textit{raster} - surface on which the LoS are determined.
	\item \textbf{Observer points} - \textit{features - points} - locations of observing points.
	\item \textbf{Observer points offset} - \textit{field - double} - field of the layer Observer points that has data type Double. The parameter specifies vertical offset of the observer from the surface.
	\item \textbf{Target points} -  \textit{features - points} - locations of target points.
	\item \textbf{Target points offset} - \textit{field - double} - field of the layer Target points that has data type Double. The parameter specifies vertical offset of the observer from the surface. 
	\item \textbf{Sampling distance} - \textit{numeric value} - value in units specified by Surface coordinate system that determines how often the points are placed on LoS. Default value is the same as cellsize of Surface.
	\item \textbf{Output feature layer} - \textit{features - lines} - output layer.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output}

Line feature class with lines-of-sight, that has Z-dimension. Specific fields are \textit{OID\_OBSERV}, \textit{observ\_offset}, \textit{OID\_TARGET} and \textit{target\_offset} which are necessary for further analyses. The geometry store coordinates (X,Y and Z) purely from the surface without the offsets which are stored in fields.

\subsection{Create Global Lines of Sight}

This tool is basically the same as \textbf{Create Lines of Sight} (sec. \ref{Sec:createLoS}) but creates LoS that does not end at target point but goes beyond it and ends at extent of the surface used to define LoS.

\subsubsection{Parameters}
The same as for \textbf{Create Lines of Sight} (sec. \ref{Sec:createLoS}).

\subsubsection{Output}

The same as for \textbf{Create Lines of Sight} (sec. \ref{Sec:createLoS}).

Since the global LoS does not end at the target point two more fields are necessary to store position of target point on the LoS. Fields \textit{target\_x} and \textit{target\_y} store coordinates of the target point for LoS and are necessary for further calculations.


\subsection{Export Line of Sight into CSV}

A tool for exporting LoS into format that can be processed outside ArcGIS.

\subsubsection{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Lines of Sight} - \textit{features - lines} - layer containing LoS.

	\item \textbf{Global Line of Sight?} - \textit{boolean} - is the LoS global? The tool tries to determine if the LoS is global based on typical fields. Warning message is shown if the tool determines that the LoS is global and this option is not checked. Default value is false.
	\item \textbf{Observer point offset} - \textit{field - double} - field of the layer Lines of Sight that has data type Double. If the field has default name (\textit{observ\_offset}) from tools in this toolbox then it is selected automatically.
	\item \textbf{Target point offset} - \textit{field - double} - field of the layer Lines of Sight that has data type Double. If the field has default name (\textit{target\_offset}) from tools in this toolbox then it is selected automatically.

	\item \textbf{Use earth curvature corrections?} - \textit{boolean} - should Earth's curvature and refraction corrections be used? Default value is no.
	\item \textbf{Refractivity coefficient} - \textit{numerical value}  - coefficient value (default 0.13).
\end{itemize}

Parameters \textbf{Observer point offset} and \textbf{Target point offset} are summarized in parameter group \textbf{Offsets}, parameters \textbf{Target point X coordinate} and \textbf{Target point Y coordinate} in parameter group \textbf{Global Line of Sight} and parameters \textbf{Use earth curvature corrections?} and \textbf{Refractivity coefficient} in parameter group \textbf{Curvature corrections}.

\subsubsection{Output}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analyze Global Lines of Sight}

A tool used to analyse Global LoS. The tool should not be used for local LoS that connect only observer to target.

For purpose of these analyses the target point can not be a global horizon. This assumption allows to properly calculate all the characteristics of global LoS.

Negative value indicates that the horizon is higher then target point, possitive value indicates that target point is highest point on LoS. Negative value does not mean that the target point is invisible as the global horizon can be located behind the target point. Units are degrees.
